Hello To TeleTwitter:

You may need to export environment variable. You can find that in Twitter Apps.

Ex:
    export CONSUMER_KEY=XXXXX
    export CONSUMER_SECRET=XXXXX
    export ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=XXXXX
    export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXXX

How to run:
    You can run TeleTwitter in the background.

    $ python stream.py

How to get your chat_id:
    Just run get_your_id.py and it will print your id in the terminal
    $ python get_your_id.py
